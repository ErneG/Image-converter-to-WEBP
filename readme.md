# Image Converter Script

This script automatically converts images added to specific folders to WEBP format and saves them to an output folder using a unique naming convention.

## Naming Convention
- Converted images are named: '[YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS]_[quality]_[original_filename:15].webp'.
- This format ensures filenames are unique and sorted chronologically.

## Configuration
- Set source folders and quality settings in `config.txt`.
- Specify the output and history folders in `config.txt`.

## How to Use
- Adjust `config.txt` with folder paths and quality settings.
- Run the script to automatically convert and manage new images.
