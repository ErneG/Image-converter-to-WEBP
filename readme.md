# Image Converter Script

This script monitors multiple folders, each with a specific quality setting, and converts new images in these folders to WEBP format. The converted images are saved to a separate output folder.

## Configuration
- Define source folders and their respective qualities in `config.txt`.
- Specify the output folder in `config.txt` (`OUTPUT_FOLDER`).
- Each source folder name should be prefixed with `FOLDER_` followed by the desired quality.

## How to Use
- Update the settings in `config.txt` to include your source folders and output folder.
- Run the script. It will monitor the specified folders and convert new images to WEBP format.
